What have I programmed?

This is a code that helps you upload your files from your computer to Google Drive. First, the code imports some special tools from Google that help it communicate with Google Drive. Then, the code asks you to specify the ID of the folder in Google Drive where you want to upload your files.

The code also creates a function called "create_connection" that helps you sign in to Google so that you can access your Google Drive account. Another function called "upload_file" is created to upload individual files to Google Drive. The code then creates another function called "upload_files" that uses the "upload_file" function to upload many files at once.


Why did I build it?

During my time in college, I developed a program to backup important files from my computer. Specifically, I wanted to safeguard my assignments from potential loss or damage. I realized that uploading each individual file would be a time-consuming task, so I created a solution that streamlined the process. As someone who enjoys using technology to solve real-world problems, this project was a perfect opportunity to apply my skills and make my academic life easier.
